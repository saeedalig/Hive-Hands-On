# Hive-Hands-On

Apache Hive is a data warehousing tool built on top of Hadoop. It allows you to query and analyze large datasets stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or other compatible file systems using SQL-like queries. Hive provides a familiar SQL-like interface to Hadoop, which makes it easier for business analysts and SQL developers to work with big data.
